Life is a wilderness, not a shackle

I've been conceptualising this story for two years now. I started it when I first entered college.

Actually, the original protagonist wasn't Claude, but someone else.

It has the imprint of my life in it, and the last time I wrote a novel properly was years ago.

I remember being in high school at the time, and now I'm rocking out as a college student. But I'll be graduating next year, and I'll try to present the best novel I can to you guys!

## About me

Taking a break from high school didn't distort the course of my life.

I still remember that ‘away forever’ leave of absence. It's pretty funny anyway.



## After

I'm not sure if I'll keep updating it in the future, but I'll keep it as the most important part of my life.
