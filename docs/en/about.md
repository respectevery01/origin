Life is a wilderness, not a shackle

(I'm a sucker for perfection, and even though I've been working on this story for a long time, I still don't think I'll be able to finish it. I'll take my time to finish it.)

Actually simply I'm lazy and don't want to update.

It has the imprint of my life in it, and the last time I wrote a novel properly was years ago.

I remember being in high school at the time, and now I'm rocking out as a college student. But I'll be graduating next year, and I'll try to present the best novel I can to you guys!

## About me

Taking a break from high school didn't distort the course of my life.

I still remember that ‘away forever’ leave of absence. It's pretty funny anyway.



## After

I'm not sure if I'll keep updating it in the future, but I'll keep it as the most important part of my life.
