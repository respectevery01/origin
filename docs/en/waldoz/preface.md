# **Preface**

Welcome to *OriginMull*. This novel was originally crafted in Chinese, and the English version you see here has been translated with the assistance of AI. For those seeking the most authentic reading experience, I invite you to explore the original Chinese text, available [here](https://fi.jask.cc).

*OriginMull* is a work of fiction, and the characters, places, and events depicted within it are products of imagination. Any resemblance to actual persons, locations, or occurrences is purely coincidental, and does not imply any form of endorsement or association on my part.
