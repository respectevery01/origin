# Chapter One: Memories

“It’s been so many days and nights now... I’ve lost count.”

“Ever since returning from Triton, I haven’t been able to sleep. That terrifying feeling—it’s unforgettable.” The elderly man with silver hair sat in a brown sandalwood chair in the living room, facing the window. Beside him stood an old wooden bookshelf, weathered by time.

The soft sunlight fell on the bookshelf, hiding the glint of tears in the old man’s eyes. He rubbed his eyes, trying to suppress thoughts of everything related to Triton, but ultimately, he couldn’t resist the overwhelming fear. He sat there rocking in the chair, or perhaps the chair was shaking him, its own life seemingly near its end.

Standing beside him was a middle-aged man wearing square-framed glasses, flanked by two soldiers in gray uniforms holding Union-made Model 41 laser rifles with a solemn air.

“Mr. Gao Fangwen, we’ve been standing here for almost an hour. Since we came in, you’ve been recounting what happened on Triton. My ears are telling me they’re tired of hearing about it,” the man said dismissively, showing little interest in the elderly man’s depiction of Triton. “Now, please tell me—where is the Origin Stone?” The man impatiently questioned, while the soldiers moved Gao Fangwen and his chair closer to him, taking their positions on either side of the elder.

The old man shifted uneasily, attempting to return to his original position, but how could an elderly man resist the strength of soldiers? Now, the man finally got a clear look at his face. Though streaks of white could be seen in his hair, his skin lacked the usual wrinkles of old age, instead appearing surprisingly smooth. It was as if he had taken some anti-aging drug with side effects that left such a striking contrast in his appearance.

His dark eyes gleamed with disdain. “You’re not the first to come looking for me,” he said quietly.

The soldiers had already removed their hands from the chair’s back. Gao Fangwen seized the moment to turn the chair back towards the window and said softly, “You’re just like the others—no progress at all. If it’s the Origin Stone you’re after, then you may as well leave.”

A brown leaf drifted into his hand. Fallen leaves in May? The elder examined the leaf, remembering his time as an astronaut. It had been around this same time of year, but back then, his team had been full of vitality, unlike this withered, lifeless leaf.

But the middle-aged man wasn’t about to leave empty-handed. He’d already spent an hour here, and Gao Fangwen hadn’t shared a single clue about the Origin Stone. Returning without anything would certainly bring reproach.

Thinking a softer approach might work, he decided to try a different tactic. “You two, leave us,” he commanded the soldiers.

“But... Elder...” One of the soldiers hesitated, now standing beside the man instead of Gao Fangwen.

“But what?”

“We’re here to protect you, sir!” they both replied in unison.

“Get out! Do you honestly think this old man is a threat to my safety?” the man shouted, losing his patience and raising his fist to show he meant business.

Understanding the command, the soldiers promptly left without another word.

“Now, Mr. Gao Fangwen, it’s just the two of us. I hope you’ll tell me what you know so I can return with answers.” After hearing the door close, the man still checked around, making sure the two dull-witted soldiers had indeed gone, then respectfully placed his hands over his chest, addressing Gao Fangwen.

The elder was silent, gazing at the leaf in his hand, and mumbled, “Perhaps bringing back that damned stone was a mistake.”

“Absolutely. You shouldn’t have brought that stone back,” the man quickly agreed.

“You think so too?” Gao Fangwen’s eyes glimmered with satisfaction. It had been ages since anyone gave him such a gratifying answer. Unlike all the others who had come before, who only cared about finding the stone, this man’s response had unexpectedly opened up his heart. Eagerly, he began to recount the story of Triton.

He spoke of ice volcanoes, tremors, nuclear explosions—things the man had never heard before, yet the elder’s vivid descriptions made him feel as if he were there. The man was so captivated by this fabricated world that he didn’t even respond when Gao Fangwen addressed him a few times.

When he finally snapped out of it, he found the elder standing before him, one hand resting unsteadily on the chair’s back, looking him over carefully. There was no gleam in the man’s eyes; his face revealed only ignorance and stupidity.

Caught off guard by the elder’s storytelling, he now stood there, unsure when he had been pulled back into reality. When he looked up, Gao Fangwen had already moved to the bookshelf, taken out a book titled *The Memoirs of Gao Fangwen*, and began reading aloud:

“I ordered the evacuation from Triton, but one by one, massive hailstones struck the Explorer. The hull sustained damage, and we hadn’t even left the ground before the ship crashed back down, followed by intense seismic activity. A rift opened beneath the ship, its propulsion system destroyed, and it plummeted into the depths of the chasm.”

“From the force of the impact, Alexander’s head struck the ship’s metal wall, killing him instantly. Leng Yan’s entire right arm was severed by a metal shard falling from the ship’s ceiling, and I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I found myself in a lab.” At this, Gao Fangwen’s voice choked with emotion.

The obtuse man failed to notice the elder’s deepening grief, and finally behaved like those who had visited Gao Fangwen before him.

“Mr. Gao Fangwen,” he interrupted, “I didn’t come here for your stories of the past. I’m Shi Xunchao, the second elder of the New Dawn Alliance, here on orders to ask you for the whereabouts of the Origin Stone.”

Upon hearing this, Gao Fangwen stopped his reminiscing, waved his hand dismissively, and turned towards the window, looking at the evening sunset. Standing, he said, “If I knew the whereabouts of the Origin Stone, I would’ve told you already.”

This was partly the answer Shi Xunchao sought, but it wasn’t enough. Carefully, he pressed on: “Perhaps you forgot where it is? It’s possible.”

As second elder, he had never shown such politeness to anyone before, and he detested this version of himself.

“After so many years, I truly don’t remember. If I knew, I would have told you.” Gao Fangwen’s impatience was clear. The fiery clouds in the sky were fading, heralding the coming of night.

Seeing no other option, Shi Xunchao left a postcard with his contact details on it. “If anything comes to mind, please contact me.”

After he left, Gao Fangwen tossed the postcard out the window, where it was carried on the northwesterly wind, eventually landing atop a tall tower.

This was the highest tower in New Xilia City—the Western Eagle Tower, and the tallest iron structure within the New Dawn Alliance’s territory. Standing 463 meters high, the viewing platform offered a panoramic view of New Xilia City.

Gao Fangwen had always loved writing at the top of that tower, overlooking the sunset. But he hadn’t visited in years, as the government’s men, like Shi Xunchao, constantly disrupted him—even though he genuinely didn’t know the whereabouts of the Origin Stone.

Such is life, full of disappointments, yet one must press forward regardless.

This was Gao Fangwen’s life philosophy. His past, perhaps only he truly understood.

In this decaying, turbulent world, there seemed to be no place for someone like him. As he once wrote: “People think that being different is wrong, but it’s actually right. The error lies not within you, but in the countless objects opposing you.”

Before he knew it, night had fallen. Gao Fangwen wondered if he would sleep tonight. Insomniac nights were always so hard to bear.
