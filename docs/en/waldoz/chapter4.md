# Chapter 4: Day of Repentance

The gentle spring breeze has passed, leaving behind two dark clouds hidden beside the sun. Accompanied by thunder and raindrops, this signals the arrival of summer.

The morning was clear and bright, but by afternoon, lightning flashed and thunder rolled. As expected, the weather forecast was unreliable.

Jask was in a hurry today, taking the subway from school to visit Claude, completely unprepared for the rain. If it didn't stop by nightfall, he would have two choices: either return to school drenched or spend the night at the hospital.

However, being with his good friend was enough to ease his worries.

May 6th was a special day; it was both the beginning of summer and the Day of Repentance. People across the country would take a holiday to remember that on this day, the old world had launched a nuclear war. To prevent humanity from repeating such a tragedy, each country has its own Day of Repentance; today is that day for the New Dawn Alliance, while the Stellar Fleet observes it on January 1st.

Claude had clearly forgotten the significance of the day and was still insisting that Jask take him outside for a walk, not caring about getting soaked.

“Are you really going out on Repentance Day?” Jask looked at Claude in disbelief. He never expected this law-abiding citizen to defy the law.

The rules for Repentance Day stated that residents could only go out in the morning, and must stay home to “repent” in the afternoon. Even the police were confined indoors, replaced by the Ninth Army, which was tasked with punishing anyone who dared to venture outside.

Though the hospital remained open, doctors were also prohibited from leaving. Anyone caught outside in the afternoon would face severe consequences from the patrolling Ninth Army soldiers. Such strict laws had greatly limited people's freedom. In recent years, many democratic parties had attempted to fight against the government to abolish Repentance Day, but their efforts had yielded little success.

Claude had once been a law-abiding citizen, but perhaps due to his amnesia, he had forgotten what he was like before.

After much persuasion from Jask, Claude reluctantly gave up on the idea of going outside. Still, he wanted Jask to push him out onto the balcony. He truly longed to get some fresh air. Jask had no choice but to comply; after all, in Claude’s current situation, he needed to support his friend's wishes.

The hospital had a back door that led to the balcony, which was actually a narrow corridor blocked by a huge wall to protect patients from the strong winds. The corridor was wide enough for two wheelchairs side by side. Various clothes were hanging on both sides of Claude’s room.

He gazed sadly at his legs encased in plaster, feeling a surge of indescribable emotions. Yet he tried to mask those feelings, intertwining his fingers tightly, striving to calm himself since Jask was standing right beside him.

The grayish-white walls were uneven, with some parts worn down, showing the passage of time. This hospital had seen better days.

Sitting in the wheelchair, Claude stared at the ancient, impenetrable wall. How he wished he could stand up.

Jask leaned against the wall, and the towering wall appeared quite small in front of him.

Claude looked at Jask, realizing for the first time how robust he was. He had always thought of him as a younger brother.

Rainwater was blown by the wind, drenching Jask’s shirt and making him shiver.

“I should have dressed warmer,” Jask said, stepping back a bit and also pulling the wheelchair back with him.

He pressed against the wall next to the back door of the room. Although he had created some distance from the corridor’s wall, he could still feel raindrops hitting his clothes.

“I wish you hadn’t been expelled,” Jask sighed. His studies relied heavily on Claude; he still remembered how Claude had helped him with a practical activity once.

Ah, those were unforgettable times, Jask thought, filled with nostalgia for those days.

Claude’s attention was fixed on the heavy clouds in the sky, completely oblivious to Jask's words. His thoughts had long been swept away by the clouds.

He didn’t know why he had been expelled, but it didn’t matter now; his best friend was here.

He thought that once the clouds blew away, the rain would stop, and then Jask could return to school. But the idea of being left alone in this closed, gloomy hospital room made him feel heavy-hearted.

“If you hadn’t been expelled, with our talents, we could have conquered New Siliya,” Jask declared boldly, lost in his own thoughts.

Only then did Claude notice Jask’s words. He collected his thoughts and replied playfully, “Of course! Not just New Siliya; we could even conquer Wall Street in the old world.”

That had been their dream since they entered school: to make a name for themselves in the largest city of the New Dawn Alliance, New Siliya.

Of course, every finance major had that dream.

“By the way, why are you so interested in aerodynamics?” Jask genuinely wanted to understand why Claude had shifted his focus to a subject he found puzzling after being expelled from finance.

Claude couldn’t answer that; after his amnesia, he had almost forgotten everything about aerodynamics. As for the book Jask had brought him that morning, he had carelessly tossed it on the bedside table. “Maybe it’s just stubbornness,” he said, fabricating a somewhat reasonable excuse. Jask seemed to have gotten smarter; he would not accept such a flimsy explanation and retorted indignantly, “What’s there to be stubborn about? Is it just because the school expelled you? Or because you chose to attend school over caring for your mother?”

The atmosphere suddenly became tense, and Claude fell silent. “Listen, I’m not saying you’re weak, but you’re just avoiding the issue, Claude.” Jask realized he had spoken too harshly and added, “Avoidance won’t solve anything.”

Yes, he had been running away from the problems since his father’s death, his brother’s enlistment, and his mother’s passing. He hadn’t even had the courage to tell his mother about being expelled from school in his dreams. For him, he had borne far too many unpleasant experiences.

Claude opened his mouth to respond but was cut off by Jask, “You’ve said before, even if you can’t remember now, that no matter what happens, you are my best friend.”

He couldn’t recall when he had said that, but seeing Jask speak so earnestly made him accept that he must have said it.

The two sat in silence, watching the rain outside the corridor gradually lessen.

The sun emerged. Jask had to leave.

He pushed Claude to the bedside, leaning down to lift him onto the bed. But Claude stopped him, saying, “I think I can get into bed myself.”

That was more like the friend he knew. Claude used to handle his problems independently. Jask clenched his fists, standing aside so as not to interfere with Claude, encouraging him.

Claude gripped the wheelchair handles. His legs seemed to regain some strength. He cautiously tested them, feeling some discomfort, but it was not as painful as the day before.

A warmth surged through his lower body, as if the previously stiff blood was now flowing freely.

He finally stood up.

“Doctor! Doctor!” Jask ran toward the door, shouting to the nurse’s station.

The female doctor hurried over. Upon seeing Claude awkwardly holding the wheelchair handles and standing, her face showed alarm.

“Oh my God, why didn’t you stop him?” she scolded Jask. Jask stood there like a guilty child, “He just had his cast put on yesterday; he shouldn’t be standing yet.” The doctor was clearly upset.

“How can you know if you don’t try?” Jask said proudly to the doctor. “After all, we’re kindred spirits.”

“You’re the only one who’s a kindred spirit; your whole family is! It’s called inseparable, you fool.” Claude gently moved his legs to sit on the bed, then kicked the wheelchair away with his right foot.

The cast on his right leg cracked open, shocking the doctor, who quickly pulled a walkie-talkie from her pocket and called for other nurses to come immediately. If the cast wasn’t re-secured, it could lead to a major medical incident, and she could end up in jail for it.

“Mr. Jask, I think it’s time for you to leave,” the doctor said regretfully; she shouldn’t have invited him to visit Claude.

However, Jask hadn’t told Claude that it was the doctor who had contacted him. It was because the doctor had seen Claude so lost yesterday that she had notified Jask.

Jask waved goodbye to Claude, happily saying, “You’d better thank me; when you get out, take me out for barbecue.” Claude felt warmth in his heart and nodded in agreement.

“Definitely!”
