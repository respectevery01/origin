# Chapter 2: Amnesia

This was one of countless business trips Claude had taken. Since being expelled from New Way Polytechnic’s Department of Finance, he had lost interest in finance—perhaps due to the lingering sense of loss.

He had recently developed a fascination with aerodynamics, and this trip was for meeting Professor Weber, the very scholar who introduced him to the field. Engrossed in a physics journal, which Weber himself had written, Claude felt an immediate connection with the professor’s meticulous writing style, especially in the area of aerodynamics.

It had taken Claude a long time to learn the home address of this learned professor. He was uncertain if his sudden visit would inconvenience Weber, yet he was already trying his best to control his excitement, having even chosen an expensive suit for the occasion.

Though he went by "Claude," he was actually of Asian descent, and his classmates often called him Liu De. Claude wore a pair of non-prescription, square-framed glasses—not because he needed them but because he liked the image they conveyed, making him appear less intimidating. After all, who would feel threatened by someone who looked like a bookish intellectual?

“13 East Stia Avenue—this should be it. But… where’s number 13?” Claude found himself standing in front of the door labeled 12, with number 14 just next door.

Strange. There was a number 12 and a number 14, but no number 13. Claude’s mind raced, trying to understand what kind of brilliant architect would design such a street.

Giving up, he decided to take a chance and knocked on the door of number 12, hoping the resident could tell him if there was indeed a number 13. But to his dismay, after waiting for some time, no one answered. Instead, a chubby woman peeked out from number 14. She looked to be nearing menopause and was chewing something, speaking in broken Mandarin: “The neighbors moved away ages ago.”

Not knowing Claude’s intentions, the woman quickly shut the door after speaking.

Perhaps Professor Weber was no longer around, and Claude’s first academic visit had ended in a premature disappointment.

He walked away from East Stia Avenue, feeling dejected.

Since leaving home that morning, he hadn’t taken a sip of water. To him, academia was more important than his own health; if he could, he’d even be willing to die in a lab.

New Virco hadn’t been this lively in a long time. Crowds filled the streets, as if celebrating something.

Claude had no interest in figuring out what the celebration was for; all he knew was that his research plans were now thwarted.

On his way home, he overheard that the mayor’s child had been accepted into New Way Polytechnic’s Department of Finance.

He himself had been a finance major once, albeit an expelled one. This sharp contrast brought back unpleasant memories. Perhaps only he understood the bitterness and frustration within him; even his friend Jasper didn’t know the full story.

The night before receiving his expulsion letter, he had been reading a great work of contemporary finance in the library. Little did he know that he’d be expelled the next day.

Firecrackers echoed, their sound thunderous, as children darted across the streets.

The scorching sun beamed directly overhead. Although he’d checked the weather forecast before going out, he hadn’t anticipated the day would be so hot. Sweat dampened his suit, and he had to find a shaded area to rest.

But all he saw were festively decorated stores, far too bustling for his taste. He much preferred solitude, which was why he enjoyed working alone rather than with a partner.

About 200 meters from East Stia Avenue, a booth caught Claude’s eye. On closer inspection, he saw it housed an old-fashioned vending machine. It looked entirely out of place, like a carriage on a modern road. Ignoring this oddity, Claude rushed over to buy a bottle of water, gulping it down in one go.

Just as he finished, he was about to throw the bottle into a trash can across the street when a small voice stopped him.

“Uncle, could I have that empty bottle?” In front of him stood a young boy dressed in tattered clothing. It wasn’t unusual to see poor people in this city, but children were a rarity.

Claude initially intended to ignore the child, but his father’s teaching surfaced in his mind: "People should show compassion to enter heaven." However, he’d never really listened to his father’s words.

He casually dropped the bottle on the ground, disapproving of the uninvited stranger. He was a distinguished scholar, not a philanthropist—a value ingrained in him during his finance studies.

The boy hurriedly bent down to pick up the bottle, thanking him repeatedly.

“Uncle, could you walk me to the other side of the street? There’s a blue ‘treasure chest’ over there, and I want to see if there are any more bottles.” Claude found it amusing that the boy referred to a trash can as a treasure chest, though he stifled his laughter, realizing it was a child in front of him.

While he initially didn’t want to help, the boy’s innocence made him nod in agreement. He looked at the stream of cars passing by, wave after wave like ocean tides.

Claude held the boy’s small, warm hand, a reminder of when he used to hold his brother Max’s hand as a child. Now, though, he was the boy’s “uncle.”

“Ah!”

The boy screamed.

An approaching car sped down from the east, its driver slamming on the brakes, but it was too fast to stop in time. Fortunately, it collided with Claude at a speed of only 30 miles per hour.

Claude couldn’t tell how long he had been unconscious or how many dreams he’d had.

In his dreams, he saw his parents and his brother—a family living happily along the New Virco coast.

There were memories of joy from being accepted into college, mixed with the anguish of learning about his father’s death. The emotions were a chaotic blur, and Claude jolted awake.

His legs felt numb, unable to move, and a sharp pain throbbed in his left hand. A thick IV needle was embedded in his arm, blood streaking down.

Apparently, it had missed a vein.

Claude drifted back into unconsciousness.

This time, there were no dreams. When he opened his eyes again, the IV was gone.

“Mr. Claude, you’re awake.” A soft voice came from a doctor in a white coat seated beside his bed, with a young nurse standing nearby.

Claude tried to push himself up, but he felt weak, his mind blank.

Who am I? Where am I? He felt he’d been asleep for a long time, yet he couldn’t recall anything. The only sensation he remembered was a deep, cellular pain.

Just then, another nurse rushed in with a test report for the doctor.

The doctor examined it carefully, finally concluding that Claude had amnesia—likely due to the impact or an existing condition triggered by the collision. Claude had long suffered from migraines, a condition the doctor was well aware of.

Claude’s headaches usually struck on Tuesday afternoons and Sunday evenings. He had developed the ailment after his father’s death, which the doctor attributed to deep emotional trauma.

This was the Coastal Hospital, close to Riverside Park, where patients could enjoy leisure activities in the park, making it a popular choice for treatment.

Three hours had passed since Claude had woken up. Although the doctor had told him much about himself, his mind remained blank.

“Alright, I think I understand who I am now, and it’s getting late.” Claude’s bed was by the window, where he noticed the moon had appeared directly overhead.

“Certainly, Mr. Claude. If you need anything, press the call button, and our nurses will assist you,” the doctor said before leaving.

Now alone in the empty ward, Claude found himself facing an intense loneliness. It wasn’t his first time confronting solitude, but this time it felt stronger than before. Or was it because he didn’t remember if he had felt this way before?

He pondered his identity, whether he had family or friends. So lost in thought, he didn’t even notice the dinner the nurse had placed on his nightstand.

But he seemed to remember something—he was an aerodynamicist, once a student at New Way Polytechnic. And he had a brother.

Yes, a brother.

With that thought, he drifted off to sleep. This was perhaps the most restful sleep he’d had, possibly due to his memory loss.
