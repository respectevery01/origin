# Chapter Three: Me

“Claude, what are you standing there for? Come play with everyone!” Claude heard a familiar and ethereal voice calling out to him. Slowly, he lifted his head. A tall, thin middle-aged man was calling to him from ahead.

The man was limping and leading a small boy by the hand. Claude looked around and found himself surrounded by an inexplicable, terrifying white mist, a feeling he had experienced before.

He desperately tried to move his legs, but they wouldn't respond. He remained frozen in place. He attempted to call out to the two ahead of him, but his throat felt constricted, allowing only a faint “ah” to escape.

“Come over here, Claude,” the middle-aged man called again. But Claude remained unable to move, watching as the man's figure grew more distant. Suddenly, he remembered.

The two in front of him were his father and his brother, Max.

He could have reunited with his family, yet was always just out of reach. He couldn't understand why, if he hadn’t allowed his father to enlist, he wouldn’t have lost a family member. Now, even his brother had joined the army. He wondered why, if he hadn’t gone to that damn university, he could have stayed home to care for his ailing mother, and he wouldn’t have lost a family member. But now, he was expelled without completing his studies.

No matter how hard Claude tried, he couldn't voice anything; his throat felt completely blocked.

He closed his eyes, trying to suppress memories of sadness and pain.

Suddenly, darkness enveloped him, and his consciousness seemed to be forcibly stripped away. His soul floated out of his body. Following the river park, he soared past New Verko and the New Dawn Alliance, climbing tens of thousands of meters, as if traveling at the speed of light, piercing through the stratosphere and into outer space. He felt like a satellite, monitoring the ancient planet—Earth. Moments later, he felt like a bowling ball plummeting rapidly, falling into the sea. He felt he was drowning, struggling for breath. But just when he was about to give up, an old, wrinkled giant hand lifted him from the water.

It was his mother.

He had tried to suppress thoughts of her, but now he couldn't help it. Regret surged within him as he looked at the aged woman before him, wanting to touch her face with his hand. Yet, miraculously, his hand passed through her face like gas. No, this was truly his mother; he was certain of it.

Claude longed to express his bitterness to this dignified and compassionate woman. I... really miss you. These words filled his mind, yet he had to swallow them back down.

He didn’t want his mother to know about his predicament.

Somehow, that giant hand vanished. Claude fell back into the sea again.

He vividly recalled the feeling of nearly drowning, but this time he did not panic. Instead, there was a hint of joy.

Finally, he could leave this filthy and decaying world.

Claude closed his eyes tightly and opened his mouth, letting the seawater flood into his ears, mouth, throat, stomach, and intestines.

He awoke. Claude slowly opened his eyes, rubbing his reddened eyelids. The vivid dream left him unsettled. He tentatively touched his legs, only to find them encased in plaster. The oppressive heat in the room made it hard to breathe. His mind kept replaying the final scene from the dream.

He heard an eerie ticking sound that struck against the last barrier of his psyche. Following the sound, he found it came from an old clock hanging on the wall opposite his bed.

I want to get out of bed; this damn plaster. Claude could no longer hold back. Perhaps it was because of the clock or the stifling heat in the room; whatever the reason, he threw off the heavy covers that enveloped him, cursing under his breath.

This plaster felt like chains binding him. He desperately wanted to rise and see the outside world, to find the memories of Max that he had lost.

In his current memory, he could only recall having a brother who was serving in the military. As for life and death, he had no idea. He longed to rid himself of the plaster that confined him, this prison-like casing that restricted all his movements.

“Mr. Claude, you can’t get out of bed yet.” The female doctor who had taken care of him yesterday entered the room at that moment. Seeing Claude trying to lower his plastered legs to the floor, she quickly stopped him. “The plaster was applied just yesterday; it can’t be removed yet.”

He looked at her with pleading eyes, but the firm look in her eyes told him it was impossible. He had no choice but to exhaust himself to place his legs back on the bed and cover himself with the blanket again, turning his head away in disappointment.

The doctor seemed to sense something. From the adjoining room, she brought out a wheelchair and pushed it to Claude’s bedside.

Claude kept his head turned toward the wall, buried in the blanket. In his subconscious, he believed only disabled people used wheelchairs. How could he, as a lofty scientist, possibly sit in one?

“Knock, knock, knock!” A gentle knocking sound came from outside the ward.

“Come in!”

“Claude, look what I brought you!” A European-looking man wearing a checkered shirt and black jeans strode in, calling out in a loud voice.

The man approached the bedside and, seeing Claude lying still, teasingly said to the doctor sitting opposite Claude, “Did you kill Claude?”

“Yeah, he was already dead when I arrived,” the female doctor joked.

“Claude, you can’t die!” The man leaned over, resting on Claude’s blanket with a faux sob, saying, “I’m counting on you to help me make money!”

“Get off! You’ll crush me if I don’t die,” Claude said angrily but quietly. Hearing the man say he was dead annoyed him, but his condition didn’t allow him to unleash his frustration.

Hearing that familiar voice filled the man with joy. He stood up and exclaimed, “You’re not dead! You scared me!”

The bed shook as Claude struggled to turn his head toward the man.

This was Jask. But Claude pretended not to recognize him and asked, “Who are you?”

“The hospital hasn’t turned Claude into an idiot, have they?” Jask was startled by this sudden, soul-searching question, looking at the doctor in panic.

“He just has amnesia,” the doctor explained.

“Oh no, oh no!” Jask paced anxiously in front of the bed, muttering to himself.

“I’m your best buddy, Jask!” He clearly couldn’t accept the doctor’s explanation. “I paid for all your medical expenses. How can you not recognize me? What will I do?” He added, trying to jog Claude’s memory.

“Thanks, but I really don’t know you,” Claude feigned gratitude while secretly delighting in Jask’s foolishness; this man, who studied finance alongside him, was still so naive as to believe such nonsense. Even if he truly had amnesia, he wouldn’t forget Jask.

“What kind of trash hospital is this? They can’t even treat a person properly. I’ve never seen a hospital that turns people into idiots,” Jask directed his frustration at the doctor nearby.

The doctor covered her mouth, trying hard not to laugh. “You really are as foolish as Claude described.”

Jask initially didn’t understand what the doctor meant, but after a moment of thought, he turned red and looked awkwardly at Claude, tears welling in his eyes. He leaned back down on Claude’s blanket and said, “You really haven’t forgotten me.”

“Get off! You need to lose some weight,” Claude shouted in irritation, struggling to breathe under Jask’s substantial frame. Hearing this long-awaited voice, Jask realized that Claude was still the same, wanting him to lose weight. He quickly released his grip and stood up.

The familiar feeling returned. Jask was overjoyed.

A year had passed since they last parted. He and Claude had been classmates in the finance program at New Verko Institute of Technology, but after Claude was expelled, Jask had followed their professor to study in Verlu City. He had returned this time to visit Claude, only to find out he had been hit by a car.

To see him, he had even asked someone to buy the new book authored by Professor Weber.

Wait, where’s my book? Jask realized he had been clutching the book in his hand since entering but now couldn’t find it.

Seeing Jask searching frantically, Claude couldn’t help but laugh. “Are you looking for this?” He had somehow sat up without Jask noticing, holding the very book Jask was searching for.

“Good, you stole my book and didn’t tell me,” Jask said, flustered and angry.

“Either way, it was meant for me. Isn’t stealing the same as taking?” Claude replied, feeling light-hearted, entirely free of the previous sense of loss as he smiled at Jask.

Jask didn’t respond further. He began recounting stories about his studies in Verlu City. Claude set the book aside and listened quietly.

The doctor didn’t interrupt them, quietly leaving the room and gently closing the door, giving them time to catch up while also instructing the other nurses not to disturb them. The time for changing dressings was postponed.
